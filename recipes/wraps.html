    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this Buffalo chicken and ranch wraps recipe, boneless skinless chicken breasts are cut into bite-sized pieces,
        cooked, then covered in Buffalo sauce, and wrapped with crisp bacon, diced tomato, and ranch dressing in heated
        flour tortillas. If desired, you can increase or decrease the amount of Buffalo sauce to your taste and add
        shredded Cheddar cheese to your wraps.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound thin-sliced bacon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
        <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup Buffalo wing sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>12 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup diced fresh tomato</li>
        <li>¾ cup ranch dressing, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and
            crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble when cool.</li>
        <li>Drain off and discard all but 2 tablespoons drippings. Add chicken breast chunks to the skillet; cook and
            stir until browned, about 10 minutes. Cover the skillet; continue cooking until no longer pink inside and
            the juices run clear, about 10 minutes more. Stir in Buffalo sauce and melted butter until chicken is
            thoroughly coated. Stir in crumbled bacon. Keep mixture warm.</li>
        <li>Heat tortillas, one at a time, in a large ungreased skillet over medium heat until they begin to form air
            bubbles and small brown spots.</li>
        <li>Fill each warmed tortilla with about 1/3 cup chicken filling and about 1 tablespoon tomatoes; drizzle with 1
            tablespoon ranch dressing. Wrap tortilla around filling. Repeat with remaining tortillas, filling, tomatoes,
            and dressing.</li>
    </ol>
